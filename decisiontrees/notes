Testing


	Construct an additional instance set which will test the predictive ability of the tree by traversing it and predicting
	
	each leaf node is a classifier?
	
	accuracy is calculated by comparing the proportion of outcomes of a given traveral combo with the proportion predicted.
	
	
Make a collection of objects that hold instances that all have the same attributes.

To traverse down the tree to find probability 
	check if node is leaf, or empty
	get the defining attribute of 
	

Still to do on part 2:

	Split hepatitis.dat 10 different ways and calculate average accuracy
